#### About Me

There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to takeoff startups: sycophants and no-nonsense engineers. I’m the kind that makes it launch.

I’m Nikita. Every software engineer needs an approach, and I found mine... And thanks to my friendship with amazing engineers, I get to work on [meaningful and exciting projects](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikonovcc).
